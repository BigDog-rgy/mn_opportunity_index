      "overview": "Minneapolis [ a ] is a city in Hennepin County, Minnesota , United States, and its county seat . [ 4 ] With a population of 429,954 as of the 2020 census , it is the state's most populous city . [ 7 ] Located in the state's center near the eastern border, it occupies both banks of the Upper Mississippi River and adjoins Saint Paul , the state capital of Minnesota. Minneapolis, Saint Paul, and the surrounding area are collectively known as the Twin Cities , a metropolitan area with 3.69 million residents. [ 14 ] Minneapolis is built on an artesian aquifer on flat terrain and is known for cold, snowy winters and hot, humid summers. Nicknamed the \"City of Lakes\", [ 15 ] Minneapolis is abundant in water, with thirteen lakes , wetlands, the Mississippi River , creeks, and waterfalls. The city's public park system is connected by the Grand Rounds National Scenic Byway .\n\nDakota people originally inhabited the site of today's Minneapolis. European colonization and settlement began north of Fort Snelling along Saint Anthony Falls —the only natural waterfall on the Mississippi River. [ 16 ] Location near the fort and the falls' power—with its potential for industrial activity—fostered the city's early growth. For a time in the 19th century, Minneapolis was the lumber and flour milling capital of the world, and as home to the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis , it has preserved its financial clout into the 21st century. A Minneapolis Depression-era labor strike brought about federal worker protections. Work in Minneapolis contributed to the computing industry, and the city is the birthplace of General Mills , the Pillsbury brand, Target Corporation , and Thermo King mobile refrigeration.\n\nThe city's major arts institutions include the Minneapolis Institute of Art , the Walker Art Center , and the Guthrie Theater . Four professional sports teams play downtown. Prince is survived by his favorite venue, the First Avenue nightclub . Minneapolis is home to the University of Minnesota 's main campus. The city's public transport is provided by Metro Transit , and the international airport , serving the Twin Cities region, is located towards the south on the city limits.\n\nResidents adhere to more than fifty religions. Despite its well-regarded quality of life, [ 17 ] Minneapolis has stark disparities among its residents—arguably the most critical issue confronting the city in the 21st century. [ 18 ] Governed by a mayor-council system, Minneapolis has a political landscape dominated by the Minnesota Democratic–Farmer–Labor Party (DFL), with Jacob Frey serving as mayor since 2018.",

      "overview": "Bloomington is a city in Hennepin County, Minnesota , United States. It is located on the north bank of the Minnesota River above its confluence with the Mississippi River , 10 miles (16 km) south of downtown Minneapolis and just south of the Interstate 494 / 694 Beltway . The population was 89,987 at the 2020 census , [ 6 ] making it Minnesota's fourth-largest city .\n\nBloomington was established as a post–World War II housing boom suburb connected to Minneapolis's urban street grid, and is serviced by four major freeways: Interstate 35W running north-south through the approximate middle of the city, Minnesota State Highway 77 , also signed as Cedar Avenue, running north-south near the eastern end of the city, U.S. Highway 169 , running north-south along the western boundary of the city, and Interstate 494 running east-west at the northern border. Minnesota State Highway 100 also terminates within city limits at Interstate 494. Large-scale commercial development is concentrated along the I-494 corridor. Besides an extensive city park system, with over 1,000 square feet (93 m 2 ) of parkland per capita, [ 9 ] Bloomington is also home to Hyland Lake Park Reserve in the west and Minnesota Valley National Wildlife Refuge in the southeast.\n\nBloomington has more jobs per capita than either Minneapolis or Saint Paul, due in part to the United States' largest enclosed shopping center , the Mall of America , which is located inside of the city. [ 10 ] The mall has over 500 stores and contains an amusement park . The headquarters of Dayforce , Donaldson Company , Great Clips , Dairy Queen , HealthPartners , and Toro , and major operations of Pearson , General Dynamics , Seagate Technologies , and Express Scripts are also based in the city.\n\nThe city was named after Bloomington, Illinois .

      "overview": "Duluth ( / d ə ˈ l uː θ / ⓘ də- LOOTH ) is a port city in the U.S. state of Minnesota and the county seat of St. Louis County . Located on Lake Superior in Minnesota's Arrowhead Region , the city is a hub for cargo shipping. The population was 86,697 at the 2020 census , [ 5 ] making it Minnesota's fifth-largest city . Duluth forms a metropolitan area with neighboring Superior, Wisconsin , called the Twin Ports . Duluth is south of the Iron Range and the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness . It is named after Daniel Greysolon, Sieur du Lhut , the area's first known European explorer.\n\nDuluth is on the north shore of Lake Superior at the westernmost point of the Great Lakes . It is the largest metropolitan area, the second-largest city, and the largest U.S. city on the lake. Duluth is accessible to the Atlantic Ocean, 2,300 miles (3,700 km) away, via the Great Lakes Waterway and St. Lawrence Seaway . [ 9 ] The Port of Duluth is the world's farthest inland port accessible to oceangoing ships [ 10 ] and is the largest and busiest port on the Great Lakes. [ 11 ] It is also among the top 20 U.S. ports by tonnage. Common items shipped from Duluth include coal, iron ore, grain, limestone, cement, salt, wood pulp, steel coil, and wind turbine parts.\n\nDuluth is a popular Midwest tourist destination. The city is home to the Great Lakes Aquarium , a freshwater aquarium. The Aerial Lift Bridge , next to Canal Park , crosses the Duluth Ship Canal into the Duluth–Superior harbor. Minnesota Point , known locally as Park Point, is the world's longest freshwater baymouth bar , stretching 6 miles (10 km). [ 12 ] The city is also the starting point for road trips along the North Shore of Lake Superior to Thunder Bay , Ontario .\n\nThe Ojibwe occupied a historic settlement at Onigamiinsing (\"at the little portage\"), the portage across Minnesota Point between Lake Superior and western St. Louis Bay, which forms Duluth's harbor. [ 13 ] For both the Ojibwe and the Dakota, interaction with Europeans during the contact period revolved around the fur trade and related activities.\n\nAccording to Ojibwe oral history , Spirit Island, near the Spirit Valley neighborhood, was the \"Sixth Stopping Place\" where the northern and southern branches of the Ojibwe Nation came together and proceeded to their \"Seventh Stopping Place\" near the present city of La Pointe, Wisconsin . The \"Stopping Places\" were places the Native Americans occupied during their westward migration as the Europeans overran their territory. [ 14 ]\n\nSeveral factors brought fur traders to the Great Lakes in the early 17th century. The fashion for beaver hats in Europe generated demand for pelts. The French trade for beavers in the lower St. Lawrence River led to the depletion of the animals in the region by the late 1630s, after which the French searched farther west for new resources and new routes, making alliances with the Native Americans along the way to trap and deliver furs.\n\nÉtienne Brûlé is credited with ",

It is the sixth-largest city in the U.S. state of Minnesota . The population was 86,478 at the 2020 census . [ 4 ] The city still has undeveloped land and farms, including the historic Eidem Homestead, a 1900s working farm that is a popular tourist attraction for families and school field trips. [ 7 ] Brooklyn Park is considered both a second- and third-tier suburb of Minneapolis, because much of the land north of 85th Avenue was developed after 2000.\n\nWWE Hall of Fame wrestler Jesse Ventura served as mayor of Brooklyn Park from 1991 to 1995. He was elected governor of Minnesota in the 1998 election on a third-party ticket and served as governor from 1999 to 2003. [ 8 ]\n\nBrooklyn Park is listed as a \"Tree City USA\" and is home to 47 miles (76 km) of trails and 67 parks, including Rush Creek Regional Trail and the northern section of Palmer Lake Park. The city is also known for Mississippi Gateway Regional Park, on the west side of Coon Rapids Dam Regional Park. Rasmussen University , North Hennepin Community College and a campus of Hennepin Technical College are in the city.",

It is about 20 miles (32 km) south of both downtown Minneapolis and downtown St. Paul [ 5 ] along Interstate 35 . Lakeville was once a flourishing milling center; its agriculture industry and other major industries are still in operation. It is one of the fastest-growing cities in the Twin Cities area. [ 6 ] The population was 69,490 at the 2020 census , [ 3 ] making it Minnesota's tenth-most populous city.\n\nLakeville first became notable in 1910 when Marion Savage built the Dan Patch Railroad Line to serve his Antlers Amusement Park. [ 7 ] While many of Lakeville's workers commute to Minneapolis, St. Paul, and more central suburbs like Bloomington, Lakeville has had major industry since the 1960s—including the Airlake Industrial Park, which is served by Airlake Airport , a regional reliever airport.",

      "overview": "St. Cloud or Saint Cloud ( / ˈ s eɪ n t k l aʊ d / ; French: [sɛ̃ klu] ) is a city in the U.S. state of Minnesota and the largest population center in the state's central region . The population was 68,881 at the 2020 census , [ 4 ] making it Minnesota's 12th-largest city. St. Cloud is the county seat of Stearns County [ 6 ] and was named after the city of Saint-Cloud , France (in Île-de-France, near Paris), which was named after the 6th-century French monk Clodoald .\n\nThough mostly in Stearns County, St. Cloud also extends into Benton and Sherburne counties, and straddles the Mississippi River . It is the center of a contiguous urban area , with Waite Park , Sauk Rapids , Sartell , St. Joseph , Rockville , and St. Augusta directly bordering the city, and Foley , Rice , Kimball , Clearwater , Clear Lake , and Cold Spring nearby. The St. Cloud metropolitan area had a population of 199,671 at the 2020 census. It has been listed as the fifth-largest metro with a presence in Minnesota, behind Minneapolis–St. Paul , Duluth–Superior , Fargo-Moorhead , and Rochester . But the entire St. Cloud area is within Minnesota, while most of Fargo-Moorhead's population is in North Dakota and Superior, Wisconsin, contributes significant population to the Duluth area.\n\nSt. Cloud is 65 miles (105 km) northwest of the Twin Cities of Minneapolis–St. Paul along Interstate 94 , U.S. Highway 52 (conjoined with I-94), U.S. Highway 10 , Minnesota State Highway 15 , and Minnesota State Highway 23 . The St. Cloud Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) is made up of Stearns and Benton Counties. [ 7 ] The city was included in a newly defined Minneapolis–St. Paul–St. Cloud Combined Statistical Area (CSA) in 2000. St. Cloud as a whole has never been part of the 13-county MSA comprising Minneapolis , St. Paul , Bloomington and parts of western Wisconsin , though the Sherburne County portion is part of the 13-county MSA. [ 8 ]\n\nSt. Cloud State University , Minnesota's third-largest public university, is located between the downtown area and the Beaver Islands, which form a maze for a two-mile stretch of the Mississippi. The approximately 30 undeveloped islands are a popular destination for kayak and canoe enthusiasts during safe river levels and flow. [ 9 ] [ 10 ] and are part of a state-designated 12-mile stretch of wild and scenic river. [ 11 ]\n\nSt. Cloud owns and operates a hydroelectric dam on the Mississippi, the state's largest city-owned hydro facility, that can produce almost nine megawatts of electricity, about 10% of the total electricity generated by 11 Mississippi hydro dams in Minnesota.

The city is situated on a bluff overlooking the south bank of the Minnesota River , upstream from its confluence with the Mississippi River . Burnsville and nearby suburbs form the southern portion of Minneapolis–Saint Paul , the 16th-largest metropolitan area in the United States, with about 3.7 million residents. At the 2020 census the population was 64,317. [ 2 ]\n\nThe name Burnsville is attributed to an early Irish settler and land owner, William Byrne. His surname was recorded as \"Burns\" and was never corrected. [ 5 ]\n\nBurnsville stands on land that once contained a village of Mdewakanton Dakota. Later, it became a rural Irish farming community. Burnsville became Minnesota's 14th-largest city in the 2020 census following the construction of Interstate 35 . Now the ninth-largest suburb in the metro area and a bedroom community of both Minneapolis and Saint Paul , it was fully built by the late 2000s. Burnsville's downtown area is called Heart of the City with urban-style retail and condominiums. [ 6 ] The Burnsville Transit Station serves as the hub and headquarters of the Minnesota Valley Transit Authority , providing regional bus service to five other suburbs.\n\nBurnsville is home to a regional mall ( Burnsville Center ), a section of Murphy-Hanrehan Park Reserve , 310-foot (94 m) vertical ski peak Buck Hill , and part of the Minnesota Valley National Wildlife Refuge .",

Sited on the south bank bend of the Minnesota River , Shakopee and nearby suburbs comprise the southwest portion of Minneapolis-Saint Paul , the nation's 16th-largest metropolitan area , with 3.7 million people. The population was 43,698 at the 2020 census . [ 3 ]\n\nThe riverbank's Shakopee Historic District contains burial mounds built by prehistoric cultures. In the 18th century, Chief Shakopee II of the Mdewakanton Dakota established his village on the east end of this area, near the water. Trading led to the city's establishment in the 19th century. Shakopee boomed as a commerce exchange site between river and rail at Murphy's Landing.\n\nShakopee was once an isolated city in the Minnesota River Valley , but by the 1960s its economy was tied to that of the expanding metropolitan area. Significant growth as a bedroom community occurred after U.S. Highway 169 was realigned in 1996 toward the new Bloomington Ferry Bridge .\n\nThe city is known for the Valleyfair amusement park and the Canterbury Park racetrack.",

      "overview": "Savage ( / ˈ s æ v ɪ dʒ / SAV -ij ) is a suburban city 15 miles (24 km) south-southwest of downtown Minneapolis in Scott County in the U.S. state of Minnesota . The city is on the south bank of the Minnesota River in a region commonly called South of the River, comprising the southern portion of Minneapolis-St. Paul , the 16th-largest metropolitan area in the United States. The population of Savage was 32,465 at the 2020 census . [ 4 ]\n\nMinnesota State Highway 13 and County Road 42 are two of the main routes in Savage. Interstate 35W and U.S. Highway 169 are in close proximity to the city.\n\nThe landing point for Irish and Scottish immigrants in 1800, Savage has grown into a developing bedroom community , absorbing population growth from Burnsville , its larger neighbor to the east. Once a shipbuilding port for the U.S. Navy, Savage is now an industrial manufacturing job center in the southern metro. [ 6 ] The city is still relatively undeveloped, with sections of the Minnesota Valley National Wildlife Refuge and Murphy-Hanrehan Park Reserve within its borders.\n\nPreviously named Hamilton after the city in Ontario, Canada , the town was renamed Savage after Marion Willis Savage, who owned and trained the nationally celebrated racing horse Dan Patch .

[ 6 ] It is near the confluence of the Mississippi , Vermillion, and St. Croix Rivers . The population was 22,154 at the 2020 census . [ 3 ] It is named for the first elected governor of Minnesota, Henry Hastings Sibley . [ 7 ]\n\nThe advantages of Hastings's location that led to its original growth are that it is well-drained, provides a good riverboat port, and is close to a hydropower resource at the falls of the Vermillion River . Other sites closer to the river confluence are either too swampy (Dakota County) or too hilly (Washington County and Pierce County, Wisconsin ).\n\nU.S. Highway 61 and Minnesota State Highways 55 and 316 are three of Hastings's main routes.",

Its population was 18,492 at the 2020 census . [ 3 ]\n\nThe city is at the junction of Interstates 35 and 90 , about 90 miles (140 km) south of the Twin Cities .  It is on the shores of Fountain Lake, Pickerel Lake, Albert Lea Lake, Goose Lake, School Lake, and Lake Chapeau. Fountain Lake and Albert Lea Lake are part of the Shell Rock River flowage.\n\nThe city's early growth was based on agriculture , farming support services and manufacturing , and it was a significant rail center. At one time it was the site of Cargill 's headquarters. [ 7 ] Other manufacturing included Edwards Manufacturing (barn equipment), Scotsman Ice Machines, Streater Store fixtures, and Universal Milking Machines. As in many U.S. cities, Albert Lea's manufacturing base has substantially diminished. A major employer was the Wilson & Company meatpacking plant, later known as Farmstead and Farmland. This facility was destroyed by fire in July 2001.",

As the official city logo of North Saint Paul, it was constructed on Margaret and 7th Streets from 1971 to 1974 by Lloyd Koesling and moved to its current location in 1990. [ 6 ]",

The car-oriented \"Miller Hill area\", or Miller Trunk Corridor of Duluth, has sprawled well past the city boundary line into this part of Hermantown. The western part of Hermantown is more rural, reminiscent of the city's past agricultural focus. Hermantown's motto is \"The City of Quality Living\".\n\nHermantown's mayor is Wayne Boucher, who won a 2008 election against Susie Stockinger. Boucher ran unopposed for a second term in 2012 and received 4,111 votes; there were 79 write-ins.",

The old canning processing plant in Le Sueur was used until 1995. It is still used for agriculture-related research for corn varieties. Peas are no longer researched at the Le Sueur plant.

The city was incorporated in 1878 and has historically served the surrounding farming community, maintaining a modest population throughout its history. In 1990, Claremont’s school district merged with neighboring districts in Dodge Center and West Concord , forming the Triton Public Schools district.
